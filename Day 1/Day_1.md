## Basic Introduciton
### Program
- Program is a set of Instructions

### Instructions
- Instructions consists of 2 Fields 
	1. Op-code (Operational Code)
	2. Operand

#### Operand 
- Variable or Identifier    
- Operands are registers, constants or literals or memory locations

#### Op-code 
- Stands for Operational Code
> Example :   

> ADD a,b  -> 'ADD' is the Op-code. 'a,b' are Operands
> 
> MLU R1, R2 -> 'MLU' is the Op-code. 'R1, R2' are operands.


>Note:  
> Registers are present inside the CPU. Registers are limited in number.  
> Cookies act as buffers and stores computer information. 

### Basic Concepts of OOPS
#### Class
Class is a user defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions.

**Visibility of a class**

    Public -> Accessible by all the members

    Private -> Accessible by the members of the class only.

    Protected -> Accessible by the derived classes only.

#### Objects
It is a real world entity. It is an instance of a class.

##### Encapsulation
	Wrapping up of data members and member functions in a unit called class is called encapsulation.
	Application -> Security
		
##### Inhertiance
	Acquiring the properties of the base class is called Inheritance

    Application -> Code reuseability.
	
##### Polymorphism
	One form with multiple operations
	
    Types :
		Compile Time (aka Late Binding)
			- Allows function overloading.
			- In operator overloading, the basic functionality of the operator will not change.
		Run Time (aka Early Binding)
			- ALlows function overriding. To aviod confusion, virtual functions are used.

##### Data Abstraction
	Helps to hide low level code from user.
	
    Application -> Privacy
	
##### Message Passing
	Allows to pass messages between objects.

> *Q:*  Why C++ is not a pure object orientated language?  

> *Ans:* Because without basic concepts of OOPS, programs can be written and executed.

### Introduction to C#

- C# is pronounced as "see-sharp"

- C# is pure object oriented programming language.

- It is developed by java scientists. 

- C# is simple, modern, general purpose, object oriented programming language.
- Everything in C# is a class object with properties and methods that can be employed by a program.

#### Applications :
- Console Applications
- Windows Applications
- Developing Windows controls
- Developing ASP.NET projects
- Creating web controls
- Providing web services
- Developing .NET component Library.
